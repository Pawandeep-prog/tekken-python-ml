<h1>Description</h1>
Hi this is new project of playing tekken game using python. In this physical movements of body are converted to in game control. For making this project I used mediapipe and pyautogui to send key<br>
inputs. Also mediapipe is used for pose estimation and from that detected pose certain decisions such as Punch or Defend are taken.
